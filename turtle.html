            <p>
            These turtles can be find in <em> Akurella, Mawella, Kosgoda, Rekawa, Ambalantota, Yala & Bundala</em> of Sri Lanka. They can be seen in all oceans with primarily temperate waters. </p> 
        <h4>breeding</h4>
        <p> Individual female green turtles usually mate every 2-4 years. They control mating; males cannot force females to mate.
        </p>
        <br>
    <p>
        After mating in the water, the females haul themselves onto the beach above the high tide line. Upon reaching a suitable nesting site, the gravid female digs a hole with her hind flippers and deposits a number of eggs in the nest & the number laid per litter depends on the age of the female. After, the female covers the nest with sand and returns to the sea.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Each nest contains 98-172 eggs measure 41.4-42.1mm. The hatchlings occur after 2 months of time. During a nesting season, one female can lay up to 11 nests.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p> The eggs hatch during the night and the newly-emerged turtles  head directly towards the water's edge. Turtles in their first five years are known to spend a majority of their early life stages in convergence zones within the open ocean.Atlantic & Eastern Pacific oceans.</p>
    <br>

        <p>Individual female green turtles usually mate every 2-4 years.Female turtles control mating; males cannot force females to mate. There is an increased survival among the hatchlings but only a few green turtle populations are known to undergo polyandry when mating.

            <h4>breeding</h4>
            <br>
            <p>female turtles become sexually mature within three years.Mating occurs every two to three years.Mail turtles wait in the water or sometimes follow females onto the shore.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Nesting process lasts one to three hours.Females drag themselves to beach at night after mating.</p>

            <p>Females create a nesting hole using their rear flipppers and lay their eggs.Then fill it with their hind limbs.Afterward,they return to the sea.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The eggs measure 30 to 35mm in size.After around two monthes,baby turtles hatch at night.They instinctively make their way to the sea,guided by the reflexion of the moon on the watrer.</p>

                These species known to nest in Karaduwa, Maggona, Bundala, MArichchikaddi, Kalpitiya, Udappuwa, Hambantota, Kundakuliya, Chilaw, Negambo, MAtara, Weligama.They generally tend to stay within the latitudes of 40° North and 40° south. It’s usually found in large range within the tropical and subtropical regions in the Indo-Pacific and southern Atlantic oceans

            <br>
            <p>
                Females choose to return to their beach of birth by remembering the smell of the beach through enhanced chemo sensors.
                <br><p>
                Females are not monogamous. Male sperm is stored within the female for use throughout the entire breeding season.Since females store sperm in their bodies for later use, a single female can nest multiple months in a row.
                </p>
                <br><p>
                Nesting takes place during the night with the females riding in on the high tide and usually coincides with the first or last quarter of the moon.

                <br><p>
                The Olive Ridley turtle is well known for its mass nesting. 

                300 or more females at a time coming ashore , approximately 50 m from the sea, digging a nest 30-55 cm deep, depositing on average 107 eggs, and then return to the sea within less than an hour.

                   These turtles can be seen in Sri lanka including Induruwa, Mawella, Ussangoda, Rekawa, Ambalangoda, Kosgoda, Bundala, Godavaya & Yala. Most often found in tropical waters and distributed around the globe in temperate oceans.
                   They travel north & live in Northern Atlantic waters and also inhabitat in South Atlantic Waters.</p>
                <br>
            <h4>breeding</h4>
            <br>
            <p> It’s known that the males returns to the same nesting beach if they were successful in the previous season.It will migrate just offshore a common nesting beach generally before nesting season begins. 

                They try to mate with as many females as possible.</p>
            <br>
            <p> female turtles swim ashore at night to nest and will produce a clutch which most may not contain yolk.

                They lay their eggs in the sand of tropical beaches.After she will returns to the ocean & No subsequent parental care occurs.
                Also, they will return to the same nesting location every 2-3 years.
            </p>
            <br><p> The nests are deeper than all other turtles & comprise 90-130 clutches of eggs. These eggs are spherical, soft shelled & 50-54mm. There usually white but may contain green spots.</p>

            <div class="p_text">
                <p>
                    They are rarely found in south & south-east shore of Sri Lanka including Kosgoda & Rakawa.  This turtle is found in nearly all the world's temperate and tropical oceans. During winter months they migrate to tropical and subtropical waters.
            </p>
            <h4>breeding</h4>
            <br>
            <p>Females grow larger.Males migrate to mating grounds.A male will circle a female, then approach her and bite her neck or shoulder then attempt to mount her and, if she accepts , they will mate. If not she covers her cloaca and swims to the bottom. Males use the long, curved claws on their forelimbs to hold on due to mating lasts for hours and other males often ram and bite the male, attempting to dislodge him. If it's dislodged, another may quickly replace him.

            </p>
            <br><p>During the nesting season a female may lay several clutches, and will re-mate each time. In some cases, she may mate several times between clutches and so a single clutch may have sperm contributed by several males. Unlike most of other sea turtles, these turtles courtship and mating usually  place  along the migration routes between feeding and breeding grounds.

            </p>
            <br><p>The size of an egg is 34.7-55.2mm.
                The hatchlings emerge usually at night . They follow the brightest light to the ocean's edge. Once in the ocean they use ocean currents to travel to the Sargasso Sea using the Sargassum as protection until they mature.</p>
